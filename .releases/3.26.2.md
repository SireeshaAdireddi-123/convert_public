**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed regression which caused any output from a `LambdaValidator` to be considered valid by the `LambdaHelper.porocess` function. In other words, invalid events will no longer be processed.

**Other**

* Lock Socket.IO version to 2.3.0 because [version 2.4.0](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/releases/tag/2.4.0) contains breaking changes.
