**New Features**

* Added the `LambdaMessageValidator` to validate individual messages passed to a Lambda Function.
* Added the `LambdaEventValidator` which delegate its work to one or more `LambdaMessageValidator` instances.
* The `LambdaResponder` was refactored, allowing it to delegate the formulation of a final response to `LambdaResponseGenerator` strategies.
* Added `LambdaResponseGeneratorGzip` which compresses response data between 1 MB and 50 MB in size.
* Added `LambdaResponseGeneratorS3` which writes very large responses to S3, then sends an HTTP 303 (See Other) response pointed at the newly written S3 object.

**Other**

* The `LambdaValidator` class is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. Use the `LambdaEventValidator` class instead.
* The `LambdaEventValidator` class inherits the `LambdaValidator` class for backwards compatibility. In the next major release, `LambdaEventValidator` will not have a super class.
